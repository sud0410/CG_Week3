## Overview

The third week was dedicated to exploring core data structures and algorithmic strategies. Topics included working with linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps, and common sorting and searching techniques. The week concluded with an introduction to algorithm complexity analysis using Big-O notation.

## Topics Covered

### 01 - Data Structure - LinkedList
- Understanding linked list structure
- Implementing singly linked lists
- Basic operations: insertion, deletion, traversal

### 02 - Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing Functions
- Stack implementation and operations (push, pop, peek)
- Queue implementation and operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- Introduction to HashMaps
- Basic hashing concepts and functions

### 03 - Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Basic understanding of how each sort works and its complexity

### 04 & 05 - Linear & Binary Search
- Linear search implementation
- Binary search implementation
- Prerequisites for binary search (sorted data)
- Time complexity comparison

### 06 - Algorithm's Runtime Analysis & Big-O
- Understanding time and space complexity
- Big-O notation
- Analyzing efficiency of algorithms

## Prerequisites
- Week 1 and Week 2 content familiarity (Java basics and OOP)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse
